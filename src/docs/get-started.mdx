It’s really easy to use our library, so for making the initialization process easier to undestand, we have separated made this tutorial bellow, step by step.

<Typography as="h3" id="basic-usage">Basic usage</Typography>

#### Step 1

Include the necessary files in the head , so that the framework work properly:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="yourpath/all-animation.css" />
```

#### Step 2

To add the animation you can enter there by JavaScrip dynamically or statically placed there by html:

```html
<div class="a-dance"> 
    Trigger Class...
</div>
```

<Typography as="h3" id="event-based-animations">Event based animations</Typography>

#### Step 3 - Optional

The usage of javascript is optional, we just demonstrate here in order to let you know how to trigger an animation after certain user action:

<br />

Using jQuery:

```javascript
$("button").click((e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    $("div").addClass('a-dance');
});
```
<br />

Using plain javascript:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    div.classList.add('a-dance');
})
```
